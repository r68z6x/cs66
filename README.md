IS 602, MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS 
SECTION 02 (10546), Fall 2024 
● Course Description 
This course teaches the fundamental concepts of information systems (IS). We first introduce the database system; learn how to structure, manipulate and retrieve data using MS Access. We will then study the enterprise systems and key business processes, using SAP as an example.    We demonstrate how enterprise systems support the execution and management of these processes, and furthermore, how enterprise systems improve internal productivity and innovation within a company and shape the external competitive landscape. After that, we will use Business Intelligence software (MS Excel, Tableau) to analyze the data which was generated by modern enterprise systems.
